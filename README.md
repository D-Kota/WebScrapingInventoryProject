This is a project that I have been working on for use at my company Rug Gallery. The idea is to use web scraping to quickly pull information from the rug vendor website for Rug Gallery use. In this working example, I created a python function called InventoryTest and set the website URL as the parameter for that function. I also created a list of some examples of Karastan URL's that were specific to the Adalia rug collection variants from Karatsan Rugs.
